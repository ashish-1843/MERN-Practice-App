# Frontend

A React + Vite frontend for the MERN app. It handles account creation, login, email verification, and a protected dashboard, while communicating with the Express backend in the sibling `Backend` folder.

## ✨ Features

- User registration
- Login flow with token-based session handling
- Email verification screen
- Protected dashboard route
- Responsive UI with React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and custom shadcn-style components
- API integration with Axios and cookie-based refresh flow

## ✅ Requirements

Before running this app, make sure you have:

- Node.js and npm
- A version of Node supported by Vite 8
- The backend running locally at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Quick start

From this folder, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000`

> The frontend API client and backend CORS settings are expected to match these local URLs. If you change ports, update both sides together.

## 📜 Available scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server with hot reloading. |
| `npm run build` | Build the production bundle in `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `npm run lint` | Run the project linter with Oxlint. |

## 🧭 App routes

| Route | Page | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/register` | Create an account | Public |
| `/login` | Sign in | Public |
| `/verify-email` | Enter the email verification code | Public |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard and navigation | Requires authentication |

Authentication is managed through the auth context. The app sends the access token on requests, uses credentialed requests for the refresh-token cookie, and restores the saved session when the app loads.

To run the full app, start the backend separately by following [the backend README](../Backend/README.md).

## 📝 Notes

- Use `npm install` before starting development.
- If you change the local server ports, update both the frontend API config and backend CORS config.
- This frontend is designed to work as a companion to the Express backend in the sibling folder.
